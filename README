ChorusReceiveInput
==================
With the mobile and wear apps, users can take Chorus on the go. Users can ask, answer, and review their
questions and responses. Information is pulled from the server and displayed on the phone (this happens
in the ChorusChat activity). The phone then forwards the information to the watch. The phone and watch
communicate using the WearableListenerService and the MessageAPI. If the requester asks a question where
Yelp may be useful to answering it, a Yelp button will appear on the crowd side. If the requester asks
a question involving the news, the system will automatically send a link to the first article on Yahoo
News about that topic.
