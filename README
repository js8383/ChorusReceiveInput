ChorusReceiveInput
==================
With the mobile and wear apps, users can take Chorus on the go. Information is pulled from the server
and displayed on the phone. The phone then forwards the information to the watch. Users can ask,
answer, and review their questions and responses. If the requester asks a question where Yelp may be
useful to answering it, a Yelp button will appear on the crowd side. If the requester asks a question
involving the news, the system will automatically send a link to the first article on Yahoo News about
that topic.
