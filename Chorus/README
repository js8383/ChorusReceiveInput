ChorusReceiveInput
==================
With the mobile and wear apps, users can take Chorus on the go. Users can ask, answer, and review their
questions and responses. Information is pulled from the server and displayed on the phone (this happens
in the ChorusChat activity). The phone then forwards the information to the watch. The phone and watch
communicate using the WearableListenerService and the MessageAPI. If the requester asks a question where
Yelp may be useful to answering it, a Yelp button will appear on the crowd side. If the requester asks
a question involving the news, the system will automatically send a link to the first article on Yahoo
News about that topic.

Mobile:
- Ask a question: Select 'Ask a question' in the Navigation Drawer. This will open the SpeakToMe activity. Type in the textfield and hit send to submit the text. Alternatively, hit the microphone button and speak. The text will be transcribed and then the user can send it to the chat.
- Review questions: Select 'Review questions' in the Navigation Drawer. This will open the ChorusChat activity. Requesters can click on a chat line to enable text-to-speech output and have it read to them.
- Answer questions: Select 'Answer questions.' This will open the Available Chats activity. Select a chat number and input text into the textfield. Or, click the microphone button to use speech input.
- Yelp: Crowd can click on the Yelp button (next to Send button) to open SearchBarActivity where they input a search term and location. These strings are queried in the Yelp Search API and results are displaced in the YelpResult activity. Crowd can click on any bit of information and it will be stored to send to the chat. They can unselect it if they no longer want to send it and it will no longer be stored.
- Logout: Click the options in the upper right corner of AfterLogin activity and select 'Logout.' This will also log users out on the watch.
